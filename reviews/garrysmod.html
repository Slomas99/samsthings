	<h2>Overall Rating:</h2>
	<h3>9 out of 10 stars (although try it with friends)</h3>
	<span class='whiteText'><pre>
	Garry's Mod is probably one of, if not, my most played games on steam. Sitting proudly at 456 hours as
	of writing this, I have enjoyed this game (almost religiously, at times) after a long day at school, 
	between study sessions and just whenever I'm bored and need entertaining.
	
	If you like any video game in general, this game has something for you. You like racing? there are 
	hundreds of racing mods, cars and etc available in the steam workshop. You like shooting? there are
	thousands upon thousands of guns and firearms-related mods available for you to use in the workshop.
	Hell, you like Virtual Reality? there's even a mod that allows for full VR support. (which I would
	reccomend.)
	
	This is because Garry's Mod itself relies heavily on its user community and modding. You can go on a
	spree in the steam workshop, download hundreds of addons and it will <i>just work.</i> Built off of the highly
	versatile Source Engine developed by Valve for games such as Portal and Half-Life 2, you can just
	download as many mods as possible and it'll work in a plug-and-play sort of sense.
	
	The game itself has no real objectives (without mods, of course). It just dumps you into a map of your
	choosing, hands you some weapons, a physics gun, and leaves you to your own chaos. I think this is another
	factor to its appeal; You can simply just do what you want. The physics engine that Source Provides is
	more than enough to entertain one for hours.
	
	But where this game really shines is in its multiplayer. Start a lobby with your mates, loaded to the
	brim with several hundred wacky and lethal mods - and prepare for pure chaotic fun. I can't say I've
	played any other game where I can put my mate Christian into a bathtub and send him flying into the
	air with thrusters, or strap him to a chair and make him spin rapidly. It is with Garry's Mod, where
	moments like these are possible.
	
	To conclude, Garry's Mod has a little for everything. It doesn't sell for much on the steam store either
	due to it's age. It is still an immensively popular game with thousands of concurrent players and I would
	wholeheartedly reccomend it to everyone - at least once.
