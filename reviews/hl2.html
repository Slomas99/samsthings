	<h2>Overall Rating:</h2>
	<h3>10 out of 10 stars</h3>
	<span class='whiteText'><pre>
	Now I may be slightly biased in this review due to how much I adore Valve and the Half-Life franchise. This 
	game sits with games such as MGS3 as some of the greatest games of all time (In my honest opinion). And I 
	would recommend that <b>everyone</b> (yes, even those who don't play video games) plays it at some point in
	their lives.
	
	From the Leaks of this game's beta and the book written by Gabe Newell "Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar"; it is
	clear to see that the development of this game was extremely tiresome, also requiring the creation of the
	<i>Source</i> engine. It cost Mr Newell himself many sacrifices in his family just to keep the game afoot. The whole
	game's story was even rewritten at one point (a year before release) due to the unrealistic goals of the
	grandiose story and it's subsequent leaking. This is a testament to how dedicated the Valve team were 
	towards getting this game out by its release date.
	
	Upon its release in late 2004, the game was hit with critical acclaim - and for good reason. The main selling
	points of Half-Life 2 were its integrated and optimised physics engine, and the improved graphical fidelity
	of Source over GoldSrc, Valve's previous engine. Needless to say. Valve smashed the ball out of the park on
	both of these factors. The Phyiscs engine, while it could be cosidered a gimmick by a cynical few, is very
	fun to play around with - and its usefulness does not tarnish thoughout the game. The player is handed a
	"gravity gun" in which the user can punt props at enemies as a makeshift weapon. It is useful to note that
	these physics went on to inspire and be used in <a href="garrysmod.html" class="blueText">Garry's Mod<a>.
	
	As for the graphical fidelity; well it was certainly groundbreaking for its time but has definitely
	tarnished over time due to better shaders etc. Although, there are several ways to improve the graphics:
	the main one being to use a mod for the game like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/290930/HalfLife_2_Update/" class="blueText">Half Life 2: Update<a> or <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/hl2-ep2-enhased-mod" class="blueText">HL2: MMod<a>.
	
	Another reason for my 10/10 scoring for this game would be the story. Although the story is not overly
	complex like a Metal Gear game, it benefits heavily from this and also experiments with different sorts of
	storytelling. The game tends to (much like Half-Life 1) make good use of environmental storytelling in order
	to immerse the player. There are also essentially no cutscenes. This is to make sure the player is never taken
	away from the action and is set on a continuous trail with no breaks. The story is in a simple way a grand 
	adventure - a prophetic mission and it is this simplicity that makes the game work so well.
	
	So in conclusion, Half-Life 2 revolutionalised the Gaming industry with its new physics engine and graphical
	fidelity. Both of which still somewhat hold up to this day. Its clever use of environmental storytelling
	immerses the player to ensure a consistent experience. The game goes for around ~£7 on Steam - or you could do
	what I did and buy the entire Valve collection in the Summer Sale for around £10. I would absolutely recommend
	this game to everyone.
