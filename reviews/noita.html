	<h2>Overall Rating:</h2>
	<h3>7 out of 10 stars</h3>
	<span class='whiteText'><pre>
	If you're anything like me, you've probably played around with those falling sand games on the app store or online.
	I feel as if one of the best ways to describe Noita is as exactly that, but innovated and mixed with a Roguelite
	style.
	
	Noita is hard. On top of having a permadeath mechanic where you have to restart fully when you die, the world is
	random and could leave you with terrible luck at any point. Many will even tell you that the game is about death
	simply because of the sheer amount of times you will die while trying to understand this game. You can and will
	die from literally anything. You'll be crushed to death by boulders, burn alive at least 40 times, fall into a
	vat of toxic sludge and/or acid, cast a spell from a dodgy looking wand - only to have it either ricochet into you
	or explode, killing you instantly.
	
	But when luck does hit in Noita, boy does it pay off. You can get wands so powerful you feel like a god. Some even
	have chainsaw spells so you can run around like the doomslayer and rip and tear your enemies. But there will always
	be that slight feeling of insecurity, as your run could be cut short by one foul move on your end.
	
	Besides gameplay, the game looks visually stunning for how simple it is. The shaders used by developers to show
	lighting and fire are just amazing - and I'll often find myself blowing random things up mid-run just because of
	how satisfying it truly is.
	
	I would definitely recommend this game to anybody who's looking for an adventure, or maybe just a challenge. It 
	recently realeased out of early access on the Steam store with a 1.0 update, massively changing and overhauling
	some mechanincs for the better.
